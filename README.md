Paper: Utilizing the Capture Effect in low power Wireless Sensor Networks

Abstract

This paper investigates the common interference called
capture effect, which is subject to ongoing research interest and
therefore has been analyzed in recent years by researchers in
context of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The interference was
studied from different perspectives and in specific network
scenarios. Furthermore it is shown that the interference is
directly related to the media access control (MAC) primitives and
generally known effects occurring in wireless networks. Another
major purpose of this work is to present insights on the capture
effect by differentiating between related appliances and
conclusions, and comparing these approaches to each other. This
includes approaches that intentionally utilize this interference to
gain desired transmission behaviour and/or optimize properties
relevant to common wireless sensor networks. One of the latest
attempts to benefit from the interference instead of categorically
considering it as an inconvenient side effect is examined, in
regard to its unusual basic approach to the effect. Previously
used methods are compared with this comprehensive one, while
considering network properties and environment, as well as
constraints related to low power WSNs. The resulting
opportunity of benefiting from the interference in an intentional
manner is taken into consideration to emphasize a possible role
of the capture effect in future research in the field of low power
WSN MAC layer transmission primitives.
